Unless you're working on this project I doubt you will want to fork this.  You're probably looking for https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php.

If you're still here:
* Ask me for commit access
* Install Pattern Lab: http://patternlab.io/docs/requirements.html
* On your machine, navigate to the directory pattern lab is in (e.g. /path/to/patternlab)
* run `rm -rf source`
* run `git clone https://github.com/clrockwell79/degondaba_pl.git source`
* Get to work!  You can compile with (assuming your in the pattern lab main folder `php core/builder.php -wr`
* You can compile the sass with `sass --watch source/css/style.scss:source/css/style.css`
